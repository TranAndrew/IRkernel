\title{Install the kernelspec to tell Jupyter (or IPython â‰¥ 3) about IRkernel.}
\usage{
installspec(user = TRUE, name = "ir", displayname = "R")
}
\arguments{
\item{user}{Install into user directory (~/.jupyter or ~/.ipython) or globally?}

\item{name}{The name of the kernel (default "ir")}

\item{displayname}{The name which is displayed in the notebook (default: "R")}
}
\description{
Will use jupyter and its config directory if available, but fall back to ipython if not.
}
\details{
This can be called multiple times for different R interpreter, but you have to give a
different name (and displayname to see a difference in the notebook UI). If the same
name is give, it will overwrite older versions of the kernel spec with that name!
